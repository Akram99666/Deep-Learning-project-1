Instruction to run the code:


Steps to run the code,

1. Hardware Requirements

a) GPU: Min 2GB
b) Camera: CCTV/Webcam/Mobile Camera

2. Install the required Libraries which are there in the requirement.txt file

3. Download the dataset from the dataset_link folder or download it from below link
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset

4. Keep all the folders in a structural way so that you wont get any errors. Download the architecture from folder structure image

5. Download the anaconda software 

For Windows: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/
For Linux: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/
For Mac: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/

8. Install all the required libraries from requirement.txt by using the command pip install -r requirement.txt

9. To Activate the environment Enter in the command prompt : conda activate project

10. Run the main module : python main.py

11. In order to train the model Enter this command: 
python train_mask_detector.py --dataset "FOLDER LOCATION OF YOUR DATASET IN PC " 

12. In order to save the train model and plot the graphs enter the below command
